## Learning Objectives

- Understand the role of economic models in health technology assessment (HTA)
- Learn how different modelling frameworks align with different types of decision problems
- Explore strengths, limitations, and appropriate contexts for common models

---

## What is HTA and Why Do We Use Models?

- **HTA** is the multidisciplinary evaluation of the clinical, economic, and societal impact of health technologies (e.g., drugs, devices, diagnostics)
- **Economic models** help synthesize data from multiple sources to estimate long-term outcomes, especially when clinical trials are short-term
- Key use: inform reimbursement, pricing, and adoption decisions under uncertainty

---

## Why Model Choice Matters

- The structure of your model influences:
  - How accurately it reflects disease progression
  - The transparency and credibility of your analysis
  - The types of uncertainty that can be assessed
- Choosing the wrong model can lead to:
  - Biased cost-effectiveness estimates
  - Overcomplexity or oversimplification
  - Misalignment with decision-maker needs

---

## What Should Drive Your Choice?

Before choosing a model, consider:

- What is the **decision problem**? (e.g., reimbursement for a new drug?)
- What are the **clinical pathways** or natural history of disease?
- Does the problem involve:
  - Time-dependence or recurrence?
  - Heterogeneity among patients?
  - Interaction between individuals?
  - Resource constraints or queues?
- How much **data** is available?
- What **level of complexity** is justifiable?

## Common Modelling Frameworks in HTA

| Framework              | Use When                                  | Pros                         | Cons                           |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------|------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| **Decision Tree**      | Short-term, one-off decisions              | Simple, fast                 | No memory or time cycle        |
| **Markov Model**       | Chronic diseases, repeated events          | Handles long-term outcomes   | Assumes memoryless transitions |
| **Microsimulation**    | Heterogeneous patients, complex rules      | Tracks individual histories  | Computationally intensive      |
| **Discrete Event Sim** | Queuing, resource constraints, timing      | Highly flexible              | Requires programming/data       |
| **Dynamic Model**      | Infectious disease with transmission       | Captures herd effects        | Very data-hungry & complex      |

## Decision Problem Examples

**Example 1: Asthma treatment**  
- Chronic condition with flare-ups  
- Use a **Markov model** with health states (e.g., mild, moderate, severe, death)

**Example 2: New surgical device**  
- One-off use, short-term outcomes  
- A **decision tree** may suffice

**Example 3: Cancer immunotherapy**  
- Time to event outcomes, variation in patient risk  
- Consider **microsimulation** or **partitioned survival models**

**Example 4: COVID-19 vaccination strategy**  
- Infectious disease, transmission dynamics  
- Needs a **dynamic transmission model**

## Strengths & Weaknesses Recap

**Decision Tree**  
✅ Transparent, intuitive  
❌ Poor at modeling recurrence/time

**Markov Model**  
✅ Good for long-term, repeated events  
❌ Assumes transitions depend only on current state

**Microsimulation**  
✅ Handles patient-level variation  
❌ Requires large data and compute power

**Discrete Event Simulation**  
✅ Realistic modeling of queues/resources  
❌ Harder to validate and explain

**Dynamic Models**  
✅ Can model disease spread and indirect effects  
❌ Often impractical without strong data

---

## Practical Advice

- **Start simple.** Only add complexity when justified by the decision problem or available data.
- Sketch the **disease progression** before picking your model
- Be transparent about assumptions — especially structural ones
- **Consult with stakeholders** early to understand decision-makers’ needs
- If unsure, pilot more than one structure in parallel

---

## Common Pitfalls

- Using complex models without sufficient data or justification
- Ignoring structural uncertainty
- Poor documentation of assumptions or rationale
- Selecting a model based on analyst preference rather than fit-for-purpose

---

## Key Takeaways

- Model choice is driven by the **decision context**, **disease characteristics**, and **data availability**
- Simpler models are often better — complexity does not always equal accuracy
- Use the model that best reflects the **real-world decision** without overfitting
